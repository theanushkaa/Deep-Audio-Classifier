# Deep-Audio-Classifier with TensorFlow

This project implements a deep learning model for audio classification using TensorFlow. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a sliding window approach to analyze waveforms and spectrograms extracted from audio data.

Features:

-> Leverages TensorFlow for efficient deep learning operations.

-> Converts audio files to waveforms and spectrograms.

-> Utilizes CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.

-> Employs a sliding window technique for capturing local patterns in audio data.
